# Java-Backend_Project
This is a very Basic Console Java Backend project made by Aryan Halwai

This project uses plain Core Java and JDBC API for communicating through the MYSQL
Database, that processes CRUD operations.....

In future several technologies like Servlet will also be added and the front-end
part will be made using plain HTML, CSS, JS (ES6) validation 

Have a Nice Day :)..........
